# Lab Management MVP: Detailed Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a lab management system using Python, Flask, Vagrant, and KVM/QEMU. The application will allow users to manage virtual machines, create and share lab configurations, and maintain documentation for their projects.

## 2. Core Setup
### Explanation:
Set up the basic Flask application and project structure.

### Tasks:
- [x] Create main Flask application file (`app.py`)
- [x] Set up configuration file (`config.py`)
- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Set up virtual environment
- [x] Install required dependencies (Flask, Vagrant, etc.)

## 3. Store Section
### Explanation:
This section will display available Vagrant boxes and existing lab projects.

### Tasks:
#### 3.1 Vagrant Boxes (Ingredients)
- [x] Create a function to fetch available Vagrant boxes
- [x] Implement a route to display Vagrant boxes
- [x] Design a template to show Vagrant box information

#### 3.2 Lab Projects (Recipes)
- [x] Develop a function to scan for existing lab projects
- [x] Create a route to list local lab projects
- [x] Design a template to display lab project information

## 4. Manager Section
### Explanation:
This section handles VM management and lab documentation.

### Tasks:
#### 4.1 Node Management
- [ ] Create a form for adding/editing VM nodes
- [ ] Implement routes for VM operations (add, start, halt, delete)
- [ ] Develop functionality for duplicating node configurations
- [ ] Design templates for node management interfaces

#### 4.2 Documentation
- [ ] Integrate a Markdown editor for writing lab documentation
- [ ] Create routes for saving and loading documentation
- [ ] Design a template for the documentation interface

## 5. Build Section
### Explanation:
This section allows users to share and import lab configurations.

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement functionality to package and export lab configurations
- [ ] Create a method for importing existing lab folders
- [ ] Design interfaces for exporting and importing projects

## 6. Frontend Development
### Explanation:
Create a user-friendly interface for the application.

### Tasks:
- [ ] Design and implement a base HTML template
- [ ] Create CSS styles for a cohesive look
- [ ] Implement any necessary JavaScript for dynamic interactions
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes

## 7. Integration and Testing
### Explanation:
Ensure all components work together and function as expected.

### Tasks:
- [ ] Integrate all modules (Store, Manager, Build) into the main application
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing of each feature
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of typical user workflows
- [ ] Debug and fix any issues discovered during testing

## 8. Documentation and Deployment
### Explanation:
Prepare the application for use and maintain it.

### Tasks:
- [ ] Write user documentation explaining how to use the application
- [ ] Create developer documentation for future maintenance
- [ ] Prepare the application for local deployment
- [ ] Create a plan for gathering user feedback

## 9. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
### Explanation:
Ideas for future development after MVP completion.

### Potential Tasks:
- [ ] Implement user authentication and multi-user support
- [ ] Add more advanced VM management features
- [ ] Create a plugin system for extending functionality
- [ ] Develop a RESTful API for programmatic access
